# Collection documentation

Site: [The Minor Family Collections](https://www.theminor.family)

Stamps that I own that are cataloged similarly to Colnect. In addition, recipes and some valueables. Ultimately this will become a stamp catalog site.


## Stamps

Various stamps I have collected since early years. Almost all stanmps are used but never hinged. 

Stamps are mainly organized by year of beginning circulation or issue. They can also me filtered by country of origin and color. Requirements for addition include being identified in Colnect's database of stamps with a Scott (Sn) #. 

### Required fields:
- Name
- Year
- Catalog number

### Issues:
- Duplicates always need research at Colnect
- Sometimes entry does not exist at Colnect
- Use alternative sites like Mystic Stamps
- Enter stamp at Colnect if it does not exist

## To-do and coding issues:
- Sorting by Catalog number needs to be added
- Styling of Twig files
